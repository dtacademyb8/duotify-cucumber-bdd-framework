For Cucumber framework we will need the following 3 dependencies:
cucumber-java, cucumber-core, cucumber-junit

In Cucumber framework:
  - the test scenarios are put in a feature file which are usually are created under resources folder
  - the feature file scenario steps are connected to step definitions through @CucumberOptions glue option in Runner class
      // Cucumber scenario step is matched to step definition method using the text of the scenario step
      // either with Regular Expressions or Cucumber Expressions
  - tags are the main way to control what scenario or feature files
  - Background -> the common steps for ALL scenarios of a feature file can be moved to Background steps
  - Hooks -> Step definition methods annotated with @Before and @After that are executed before/after each SCENARIO
             The annotated methods can be added into any class under Step Definitions folder but usually added into a separate class


  Cucumber parametrized step enables the step to be used multiple times with different sets of data and prevents multiple step snippet generation

  Cucumber automatically converts matching types(String,int, double) from scenario step into corresponding parameter({string},{int},{double}) and adds it to a snippet method as a parameter:
  Ex:
      Scenario Step:           Given I have 5 pounds of cucumbers of type "Cuke" that cost me 5.99 dollars

      Generated snippet:        @Given("I have {int} pounds of cucumbers of type {string} that cost me {double} dollars")
                                public void i_have_pounds_of_cucumbers_of_type_that_cost_me_dollars(Integer int1, String string, Double double1) {

                                }






     If you need to specify information in a scenario that won't fit on a single line, you can use a DocString. (""" """)
       When you use a doctring make sure to put each triple quote on its own line.
       Ex: Scenario: Example scenario for Database
           When I send the following query
             """
                select first_name,last_name,email,address,district,city,country from customer
                join address
                on customer.address_id = address.address_id
                join city
                on address.city_id  = city.city_id
                join country
                on city.country_id = country.country_id;
              """

           What are some common Cucumber exceptions?

           UndefinedStepException -  when a scenario step does not have matching step definition method

           PendingException - default exception that added to each step definition snippet

           AmbiguousStepDefinitionsException - this happens when one step has more than one matching step definitions

           DuplicateStepDefinitionException - happens when there are more than one step definitions with the exactly matching text

           CucumberException: Could not convert arguments for step [I pass this information] defined at - happens when setep definition parameter
                              type does not match the datatable





           Cucumber DataTable - a cucumber structure that enables table-style data to be passed from a SINGLE step of a Cucumber scenario
                                into the step definition method

             Example:           Given I am on homepage
                                When I pass this information
                                | John | Doe | 12/09/1999 | 235-345-1234 | 322-09-6322 | 123 Main St, Vienna VA 22056 |

              The DataTable is added to the cucumber step definition method as a parameter, we simply need to replace it with corresponding
              Java data structure for automatic transformation. The allowed types are List<E>, List<List<E>>, List<Map<K,V>>,
               Map<K,V>  Map<K, List<V>> where E,K,V must be a String, Integer, Float, Double, Byte, Short, Long

           When Cucumber converts the DataTable into corresponding Java data structures (List, Map), it creates
           unmodifiable versions of these data structures. If you need to modify, you need to convert into a modifiable type

           Running tests thru CMD in Cucumber Framework:



           -Add Maven Surefire plugin (latest version)
           - Configure it by including the name of the class to run:

                              <configuration>
                                   <includes>
                                       <include>**/*CucumberRunner.java</include>
                                   </includes>
                               </configuration>

           - run with mvn test

           Running scenarios with specific tags thru cmd:

           mvn verify -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@temp"
           mvn verify -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@test and @temp"
           mvn verify -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@test or @temp"
           mvn verify -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@test and not @temp"

           When you run your test through CMD using Maven, tags passed thru CMD will override the tags from CucumberRunner class.

           In Cucumber framework we can implement data-driven testing natively with Scenario Outline with Examples table.

           The difference between DataTable and Scenario Outline Examples table -> datatable belongs to one step of the scenario, examples table applies to the entire scenario

           If we have a large a dataset it can also be read from an external file such as csv or excel file.
           To read from excel file we use Apache POI library.

           Cucumber comes with built-in Junit 4 by default and it does not have soft assertions. Hence we use AssertJ library to implement soft assertions:
           Ex:

                SoftAssertions softAssertions = new SoftAssertions();
                softAssertions.assertThat( "actual").isEqualTo("expected");
                softAssertions.assertAll();





           @RunWith -> Junit annotation that makes the class a runnable class
           @CucumberOptions -> Cucumber annotation that helps us configure cucumber options to run the tests




      Maven Dependency vs Maven Plugin?

      Maven Dependency -> Libraries that are needed to build our framework (Selenium, Faker, TestNG, Webdrivermanager ). They can do anything
      Maven Plugin -> tools that do maven specific tasks such as clean, run tests, genrerate reports, etc.
